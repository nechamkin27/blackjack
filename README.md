Terminal Interactive Blackjack

This Blackjack application is designed to be an interactive blackjack game played from the terminal. 
The desire of the final application is to simulate a configurable amount of hands in the game,
with inputs of betting, splitting hands, and insurance strategies. This will then be used as data
seen in graphical form.
